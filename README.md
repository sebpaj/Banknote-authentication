# Banknote-authentication
Banknote authentication using Perceptron and Adaline
Trying two algorithms Perceptron and ADALINE which well performed analysis on the iris dataset with bankote authentication dataset.
Results are not good enough. For such a data we need to apply different methods.

Dataset description:
1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) 
4. entropy of image (continuous) 
5. class (integer) 0, for authentic and 1 for inauthentic

For classification only two parameters where chosen: 1 and 4.
